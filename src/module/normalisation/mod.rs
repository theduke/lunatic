//! Each compiler that supports WebAssembly as a target (Rust, C, AssemblyScript, ...), will produce
//! slightly different WASM modules. It's impossible for Lunatic to provide just one interface that
//! *correctly* works with all the subtle abstraction differences chosen by each language. To solve
//! this issue we run a normalisation step on each WASM module before compiling it.
//!
//! This module contains a collection of patches that represent accumulated knowledge of specific
//! modifications, that need to be applied to a WASM module to correctly work when used from Lunatic.
//! This module will grow with time, as more languages are supported by Lunatic and more edge cases
//! are encountered.
